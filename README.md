### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are several steps I can use to ensure that my code, program or software is functional through software testing. Conducting unit tests, integration tests, and system tests can help identify and fix any bugs or issues, ensuring the code performs as expected. Additionally, following secure coding practices, such as input validation, data encryption, and proper error handling, helps mitigate vulnerabilities and safeguard against security threats. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Effectively communicating with users and engaging with them through different mediums such as interviews, surveys or usability testing allows for a better understanding of their requirements and expectation, by actively listening to user feedback and incorporating their suggestions into the program, I find that, thatâ€™s the best way to ensure that the software aligns with their needs.

### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by, understanding the problem and defining clear objectives, then breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks in order to facilitate the design process and finally employing software design principles like modularity, reusability, and scalability helps create a robust and maintainable system. In addition to that I find iterative design processes, such as Agile or Scrum, enable frequent feedback and adaptation, resulting in improved software design.
